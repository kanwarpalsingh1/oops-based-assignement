    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behavior) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It restricts access to the internal state of objects and only allows operations through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps in hiding the implementation details and protects the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows the programmer to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves it. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define the structure and behavior of objects without providing the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can inherit properties (attributes and methods) from another class, called the superclass or base class. The class that inherits from the superclass is called the subclass or derived class. Inheritance promotes code reusability and allows the creation of a hierarchy of classes with shared behavior and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on different forms or behaviors depending on the context. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, thereby enabling a single interface to represent multiple types of objects. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (in the case of inheritance) and method overloading.\n",
